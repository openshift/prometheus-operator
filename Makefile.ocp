# OCP CI builder images set GOFLAGS=-mod=vendor globally which breaks
# golangci-lint's "custom" command (it creates a temp project without a
# vendor directory). Unsetting GOFLAGS is safe here because:
# - go test auto-detects the vendor/ directory
# - go install calls already pass -mod=readonly explicitly
# - operator-no-deps targets pass -mod=vendor explicitly
unexport GOFLAGS
